# Shader Tools for Visual Studio

[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/tgjones/HlslTools](https://badges.gitter.im/tgjones/HlslTools.svg)](https://gitter.im/tgjones/HlslTools)

A Visual Studio extension that provides enhanced support for editing High Level Shading Language (HLSL) files and Unity ShaderLab shaders.
Shader Tools works with both Visual Studio 2015 and Visual Studio 2017.

Download the extension at the [VS Gallery](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/75ddd3be-6eda-4433-a850-458b51186658) 
or get the [nightly build](http://vsixgallery.com/extension/7def6c01-a05e-42e6-953d-3fdea1891737/).

See the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md) for changes and roadmap.

### Why use Shader Tools?

Visual Studio itself includes basic support for editing HLSL files - and, with Visual Studio Tools for Unity installed,
it also includes basic support for editing Unity shaders.

In addition to those basic features, Shader Tools for Visual Studio includes many more navigational and editing features:

There are more features [on the roadmap](CHANGELOG.md).

### Features

#### Statement completion

Just start typing, and Shader Tools will show you a list of the available symbols (variables, functions, etc.)
at that location. You can manually trigger this with the usual shortcuts: `Ctrl+J`, `Ctrl+Space`, etc.

![Statement completion demo](art/statement-completion.gif)

#### Signature help

Signature help (a.k.a. parameter info) shows you all the overloads for a function call, along with information (from MSDN)
about the function, its parameters, and return types. Typing an open parenthesis will trigger statement
completion, as will the standard `Ctrl+Shift+Space` shortcut. Signature help is available for all HLSL functions and methods,
including the older `tex2D`-style texture sampling functions, and the newer `Texture2D.Sample`-style methods.

![Signature help demo](art/signature-help.gif)

#### Reference highlighting

Placing the cursor within a symbol (local variable, function name, etc.) will cause all references to
that symbol to be highlighted. Navigate between references using `Ctrl+Shift+Up` and `Ctrl+Shift+Down`.

![Reference highlighting demo](art/reference-highlighting.gif)

#### Navigation bar

![Navigation bar demo](art/navigation-bar.gif)

#### Navigate To

Shader Tools supports Visual Studio's Navigate To feature. Activate it with `Ctrl+,`, and start typing the name
of the variable, function, or other symbol that you want to find.

![Navigate To demo](art/navigate-to.gif)

#### Live errors

Shader Tools shows you syntax and semantic errors immediately. No need to wait till compilation!
Errors are shown as squigglies and in the error list.

![Live errors demo](art/live-errors.gif)

#### Go to definition

Press F12 to go to a symbol definition. Go to definition works for variables, fields, functions, classes,
macros, and more.

![Go to definition demo](art/go-to-definition.gif)

#### Quick info

Hover over almost anything (variable, field, function call, macro, semantic, type, etc.) to see a Quick Info tooltip.

![Quick info demo](art/quick-info.gif)

#### Preprocessor support

Shader Tools evaluates preprocessor directives as it parses your HLSL code, and grays out excluded code.
If you want to make a code block visible to, or hidden from, Shader Tools, use the `__INTELLISENSE__` macro:

![__INTELLISENSE__ macro demo](art/intellisense-macro.gif)

#### Options

Configure HLSL- and ShaderLab-specific IntelliSense and formatting options. If you really want to, you can disable IntelliSense altogether
and just use Shader Tools' other features. You can also set HLSL- and ShaderLab-specific highlighting colours in 
Tools > Options > Environment > Fonts and Colors.

![Options demo](art/options.gif)

### Extras

#### The code

Shader Tools includes [handwritten parsers for HLSL and ShaderLab](https://github.com/tgjones/HlslTools/blob/master/src/ShaderTools).
It initially used an ANTLR lexer and parser,
but the handwritten version was faster, and offered better error recovery.

Shader Tools has a reasonable test suite - although it can certainly be improved. Amongst more granular tests,
it includes a suite of 433 shaders, including all of the shaders from the DirectX and Nvidia SDKs, and Unity's built-in shaders.
If you want to contribute gnarly source files that push HLSL and ShaderLab to its limit, that would be great!

#### Syntax visualizer

Inspired by Roslyn, Shader Tools includes a syntax visualizer for HLSL source files. It's primarily of interest to Shader Tools developers,
but may be of interest to language nerds, so it's included in the main extension. Open it using `View > Other Windows > HLSL Syntax Visualizer`.

![Syntax visualizer demo](art/syntax-visualizer.gif)

### Custom preprocessor definitions and additional include directories

HLSL Tools will, by default, only use the directory containing the source file to search for `#include` files.

You can customise this, and add additional preprocessor definitions, by creating a file named `shadertoolsconfig.json`:

``` json
{
  "hlsl.preprocessorDefinitions": {
    "MY_PREPROCESSOR_DEFINE_1": "Foo",
    "MY_PREPROCESSOR_DEFINE_2": 1
  },
  "hlsl.additionalIncludeDirectories": [
    "C:\\Code\\MyDirectoryA",
    "C:\\Code\\MyDirectoryB",
    ".", // Directory containing this config file
    "..\\RelativeDirectory"
  ]
}
```

HLSL Tools will look for a file named `shadertoolsconfig.json` in the directory of an opened file,
and in every parent directory. A search for `shadertoolsconfig.json` files will stop when the drive
root is reached or a `shadertoolsconfig.json` file with `"root": true` is found. If multiple config
files are found during this search, they will be combined, with properties in closer files taking
precedence.

Config files are cached for performance reasons. If you make make changes to a config file,
you'll need to close and re-open any source files that use that config file.

* Much of the code structure, and some of the actual code, comes from [Roslyn](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn).
* [NQuery-vnext](https://github.com/terrajobst/nquery-vnext) is a nice example of a simplified Roslyn-style API,
  and Shader Tools borrows some of its ideas and code.
* [Node.js Tools for Visual Studio](https://github.com/Microsoft/nodejstools) and
  [Python Tools for Visual Studio](https://github.com/Microsoft/PTVS) are amongst the best examples of how to build
  a language service for Visual Studio, and were a great help.
* [ScriptSharp](https://github.com/nikhilk/scriptsharp) is one of the older open-source .NET-related compilers,
  and is still a great example of how to structure a compiler.
* [LangSvcV2](https://github.com/tunnelvisionlabs/LangSvcV2) includes many nice abstractions for some of the more
  complicated parts of Visual Studio's language service support.
